Featuring: Protecting OpenBSD from DMA Attacks

> Operating systems continue to be susceptible to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks by malicious I/O devices. While the Input/Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) provides ways to protect the hostâ€™s physical memory from potential tampering, IOMMUs often are not used correctly, or not even used at all due to performance penalties.  This talk gives an overview of the troubles and presents a possible design alternative.
