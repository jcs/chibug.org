title: "ChiBUG Shutting Down"

Due to constantly low meeting turnout and lack of overall engagement, the few of
us regulars agreed this evening to shut down ChiBUG.

Admittedly the BSD-related content of our meetings was often non-existent
anyway and it was just an excuse to eat pizza, but since we hardly ever had
new people join our meetings, we'll just drop the pretense of having anything
to do with BSD.

Thanks to everyone that has come out to our meetings in the past ~7 years.
