---

Due to the possibility of the Cubs playing on Wednesday night, we have
rescheduled November's meeting for next week, on Wednesday, November 9th.

November's ChiBUG meeting will be of the more social type with no talks
scheduled.
We will be meeting at 6pm on Wednesday, November 9th at
[Monk's Pub](http://www.monkspubchicago.com/)
at 205 W Lake St in Chicago.

If you can't find the ChiBUG table, just email
[jcs](mailto:jcs@jcs.org)
when you arrive.
